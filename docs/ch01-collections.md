## Fundamental data structures

### Array

**Array** is one of most fundamental data structures.
Many programming languages provide array as a built-in feature.

When we use an array, or specifically, request to use it to the operating system,
contiguous memory is allocated for the request.
One main disadvantage of array is that we need to determine the size before using it.
To overcome this limitation, we can make 'growing' array, which dynamically resizes as needed.

### Linked list

**Linked list** is another fundamental data structure, but it is not built-in in many programming languages (one of the exceptions is Lisp).

The linked list consists of nodes, but unlike array, it does not take contiguous memory.
Since it requires additional memory management, manipulating a linked list can be more error-prone, even in programming language with garbage collection.
